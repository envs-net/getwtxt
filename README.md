# getwtxt [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/getwtxt/getwtxt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/getwtxt/getwtxt)

twtxt registry written in Go. Still in very early development. I'm a bit
obsessive over personal projects, though, so it should advance quickly.

**Update 2019-05-19**
  * I decided to branch off the registry utility functions into a library, 
so that's what I've been working on the last few days. They are available
at [github.com/getwtxt/registry](https://github.com/getwtxt/registry). Now
that I've completed the library, I can return to this side of the project.
